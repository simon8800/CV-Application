# Resume Builder

A small application where users can input their information to generate a résumé.

## Deliverables

- [] User can add generation information like name, email, and phone number
- [] User can add educational experience (school name, title of study, and date of study)
- [] User can add practical experience (company name, position title, main responsibilities of the job, date from and until when you worked for that company)

## Thoughts

- How do I create reusable forms and pass in props that allow the forms to create inputs?
  - Each input needs a name, id, and input type
  - Currently using an array of input objects to populate a Form component
